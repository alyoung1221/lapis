# Lapis

Created by a team of IT students at GMU, Lapis is a friend-finding service that allows users to make connections and build relationships based on hobbies and interests. Once verified, users can build a profile that includes a photo and information about themselves, including their favorite hobbies. With location-based filtering, users can narrow their search down to find friends in their area. Registration would be free and include basic functionalities. Subscription-based capabilities would include features such as group organizations, discussion forums and calendars for event planning.
